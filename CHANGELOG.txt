CHANGELOG

This is a CHANGELOG for spdr.
Project’s GIT repo: https://github.com/sierdzio/spdar

2014-01:
 - start a general rewrite of the codebase with use of PIMPL and friends
 - spdr is divided into a core library, a GUI, a CLI, and a set of tests
   and benchmarks
 - make Qt 5 a hard dependency (drop Qt 4 support, at least from CLI and GUI.
   libspdr should still be buildable using Qt 4, but not tested)

2014-01-12:
 - fully rename the project to spdr
 - clean up
 - update various descriptions
 - migrate to doxygen documentation
 - change the license to WTFPL (yeah!). See http://www.wtfpl.net/about/

2012-05-06 12:44 CEST:

   needed to cleanly build sPDaR),

 - make local CHANGELOG and README, delete the online one.
