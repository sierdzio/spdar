This is an on-line README for sPDaR (https://sourceforge.net/projects/spdar/).

1. This a very early version of this file. It will be updated in the future.

2. To download photos:
 a) connect media containing photos (if you have them somewhere remote),
 b) click "Select folder to import from" and browse to the folder containing photos (CR2, JPG, TIFF are currently supported),
 c) click "Select folder to export to" and browse target folder (all photos will be copied there),
 d) select folder structure (currently only one is available),
 e) click the “Transfer!” button.

3. To redistribute photos:
 a) click “Select folder containing photos” and browse to your archive location (where developed/ processed photos are),
 b) click “Select the destination folder” and browse to your destination,
 c) click “Transfer!” button to start copying developed photos.

Note that sPDaR copies JPG and TIFF files that have no other version (no RAW file). Other JPG and TIFFs are being MOVED. This meand that those files are deleted in the source archive, and are transfered to the destination archve.

This way, you will have two archives: a “developer” one, containing orginal RAW, JPG and TIFF files, and another “user” one, where only the developed/ processed files are stored (not RAWs).
