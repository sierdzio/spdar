README

This is an on-line README for spdr.
Projectâ€™s GIT repo: https://github.com/sierdzio/spdr

WARNING: spdr is in the process of being rewritten with different functionality
in mind!

Here will be some real info once the functionality is ready. For now, best see
"rewrite plan.txt" to get an idea about what future awesomeness will spdr bring!

System requirements:
any working PC/ Mac or other device that Qt runs on, Qt 5.2 installed (minimum).


Project's TODO:
 - a LOT :-)
 - use EXIF comparison
 - use DIFF comparison
 - use lazy caching (calculate SHA only when really needed)
 - implement all SpdrSynchronize flags, especially including "no cache"
 - CLI
 - GUI
