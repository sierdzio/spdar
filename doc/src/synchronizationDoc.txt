Synchronize operation is the core functionality of Spdr. The aim is to merge the
folders so that the output folder and file structure is exactly the
same as in the input folder, and to do it will as little effort as possible. If
you have ever tried to manually copy your movie or foto collection into an
archive, you probably know how hard and error-prone that can be. Spdr will do it
for you automatically and fast. The algorithm optimizes the whole operation by
skipping updates for unchanged files and minimizing the file operations that
need to be performed on the hard drive.
