  \brief A more detailed description of how importing works

Import operation works by copying all files from input directory to the output,
and sorting them according to specified formatting options (based on date and
time).

Formatting tags follow a very simple syntax. If you want the files to be put
in a folder named after the year they were created in, use this tag: <yyyy>.
If you need a deeper structure, with a month and a year, do this: <yyyy>/<MM>.
You can also add some custom folders in-between: <yyyy>/videos/<MM>. Spdr supports
all formatting tags of QDateTime class. See http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qdatetime.html#fromString-2

Spdr import can also do wildcard matching of directories. Consider this example:
you use Spdr to download photos from your camera, using this output path:
\verbatim
/home/me/photos/<yyyy>/<MM>/<yyyy-MM-dd>
\endverbatim

This creates a nice file structure for you, placing every picture in a folder
that clearly states when it was taken. The problem is, of course, that there is
little information there. So, you later add folder names by hand, with a short
description on what where you were on that day. For example:
2014/
  01/
    2014-01-01 - new year celebratons on the Moon
    2014-01-15 - my friend's birthday
    etc.

If you have taken more photos later, and use Spdr's import again, it will happily
copy all the files again, creating "clean" directory names. So the result will
be a duplication of data. To prevent this, add a wildcard star sign '*' to your
path, like this:
\verbatim
/home/me/photos/<yyyy>/<MM>/<yyyy-MM-dd>*
\endverbatim

If you run the import using that as the output folder, Spdr will detect, that
photos for 2014-01-01 and 2014-01-15 already exist, and will copy any new files
created that day into those folders.
