  \brief A more detailed description of how importing works

Import operation works by copying all files from input directory to the output,
and sorting them according to specified formatting options (based on date and
time). If Move is used as the CopyMode, Spdr will move the files instead (meaning:
they will be remmoved from the input folder).

Examples in documentation talk mostly about importing photos and videos from
cameras, but that is just to help in understanding the ideas. Spdr can be used
to import any kind of files.

Formatting tags follow a very simple syntax. If you want the files to be put
in a folder named after the year they were created in, use this tag: <yyyy>.
If you need a deeper structure, with a month and a year, do this: <yyyy>/<MM>.
You can also add some custom folders in-between: <yyyy>/videos/<MM>. Spdr supports
all formatting tags of QDateTime class. See http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qdatetime.html#fromString-2

Spdr import can also do wildcard matching of directories. Consider this example:
you use Spdr to download photos from your camera, using this output path:
\verbatim
/home/me/photos/<yyyy>/<MM>/<yyyy-MM-dd>
\endverbatim

This creates a nice file structure for you, placing every picture in a folder
that clearly states when it was taken. The problem is, of course, that there is
little information there. So, you later add folder names by hand, with a short
description on what where you were on that day. For example:
2014/
  01/
    2014-01-01 - new year celebratons on the Moon
    2014-01-15 - my friend's birthday
    etc.

If you have taken more photos later, and use Spdr's import again, it will happily
copy all the files again, creating "clean" directory names. So the result will
be a duplication of data. To prevent this, add a wildcard star sign '*' to your
path, like this:
\verbatim
/home/me/photos/<yyyy>/<MM>/<yyyy-MM-dd>*
\endverbatim

If you run the import using that as the output folder, Spdr will detect, that
photos for 2014-01-01 and 2014-01-15 already exist, and will copy any new files
created that day into those folders.

To actually perform the import operation, Spdr needs to know:
 - the input folder (where to import *from*)
 - the output folder (where the data should be put; this includes the formatting
   tags)

There are also some additional settings that can be set:
 - CopyMode can be changed move the files instead of copying them
 - simulation mode can be turned on
 - logging can be enabled
 - log file can be specified
