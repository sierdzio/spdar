  \brief Describes what and when has changed in Spdr

  \ref index "Go to the main page"

  All changes to Spdr can be taken from git repository log. Since that log is
  long, full of technical jargon and abbreviations, the project also maintains
  a separate CHANGELOG file. It contains important, user-visible changes to
  Spdr library and applications.
