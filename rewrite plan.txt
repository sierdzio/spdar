sPDaR - rewrite plan.

As of  12.01.2014, the plan is to completely rewrite sPDaR. Project will change
it's name to spdr, license will from now on be WTFPL. Spdr will be a tool for
merging (intelligent syncing) of folders, for example when copying large
collection of files between computers. It will detect what changes have been
made and try to bring the output directory up to date.

Core functionality will be moved into a library: libspdr. On top of that library,
a Command Line application will be written, as well as a GUI (using Qt Widgets,
and possibly also another one using Qt Quick 2).

Current sPDaR functionality will be renamed to "Import directory" and be just
a small part of the whole project. The code will be analysed and reviewed, as
currently it's rather old and rusty.

All new code will be (hopefully) unit tested. Also, benchmarks will be implemented
to test how well spdr fares under certain conditions. The whole project must
have a comprehensive logging capabilities.
